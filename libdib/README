This is a simple lib to convert window dib (.bmp files) to
xpm files. 

Currently it doesnt do any bmp files except uncompressed ones, its
original use is as part of the wmf decoder called wmflib which is
in itself part of the mswordview project that reads the window
word format.

Its released under the LGPL for what its worth.
