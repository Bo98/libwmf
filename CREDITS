A lot of this source code is derived from selected portions of wine
code, wine can be found at http://www.winehq.com. Where ive found
problems in wine's handling of metafile's and graphics ive 
endevoured to create patches and submit them to wine, see the
winepatches dir for them.

* the majority of the code is my own work, Caolan.McNamara@ul.ie 
	(http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan)
* the fig code is written by David.Airlie@ul.ie

* zooming in with xwmf (+ and -) is by Raj Manandhar <raj@colsa.com>
