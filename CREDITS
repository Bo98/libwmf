A lot of this source code is derived from selected portions of wine
code, wine can be found at http://www.winehq.com. Where ive found
problems in wine's handling of metafile's and graphics ive 
endevoured to create patches and submit them to wine, see the
winepatches dir for them.

* the majority of the code is my own work, Caolan.McNamara@ul.ie 
	(http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan)
* the fig code is written by David.Airlie@ul.ie 
	(http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied)

  checking in stuff, good ideas,...)
* Contribution by Steven Michael Robbins (simpler configure.in)
* Contribution to Xfig output by Frédéric Vivien.
* Debugging help by Benjamin Geer, Peter Ohlerich,
