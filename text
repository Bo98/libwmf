first find a font that matches the face,

if this fails, then in the case of a few known types look for an alias
if this fails or is inappropiate just go for either a proportional or
fixed depending on the the font.
if this fails fallback to fixed.

then ask for the size, X will always give us an appropiate size anyway.

for bold and italic etc start off with the desired one and slip
by degrees.
